# Improved Drowsiness Detection Component

This document provides information about the improved drowsiness detection component that has been implemented to fix issues with the original implementation.

## Key Improvements

1. **Face-API.js Only Approach**: The new implementation uses only face-api.js instead of trying to combine face-api.js with TensorFlow.js, which was causing compatibility issues in the browser.

2. **Simplified Detection Flow**: Removed complex fallback logic that was causing race conditions and camera jams. The new approach directly accesses the webcam and processes frames locally.

3. **Following Emotion Recognition Pattern**: The implementation follows the same successful pattern used in the emotion-display component, which works reliably.

4. **Reduced Dependencies**: Eliminated dependencies on backend Python service for operation, making it more reliable in standalone mode.

5. **Error Handling**: Better error handling and recovery when camera access is interrupted.

## Using the Improved Component

1. **Swapping Components**: Run the `swap_monitors.bat` batch file provided to automatically replace the original monitor with the improved version.

2. **Reverting Changes**: If needed, the batch file creates a backup that can be restored following the instructions shown at the end of the swap process.

## Technical Details

### How it Works

1. **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**: The drowsiness detection works by calculating the EAR value from facial landmarks. When eyes are open, the EAR value is higher; when closed, it's lower.

2. **Drowsiness Detection**: The component considers someone drowsy when:
   - Their EAR value stays below a threshold for several consecutive frames
   - This indicates prolonged eye closure, which is a sign of drowsiness

3. **Blink Detection**: The component also tracks blinks (short eye closures) as a secondary indicator.

### Files Modified

- `localDrowsinessDetection.js`: Reimplemented to use only face-api.js without TensorFlow.js dependency
- `drowsinessDetectionController.js`: Updated to better handle fallbacks and reduce errors
- `drowsiness-monitor-simple.tsx`: Created as a simplified version following the emotion-display pattern

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the camera:

1. Ensure camera permissions are granted to the browser
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Check that no other applications are using the camera
4. If the camera seems stuck, stop and restart monitoring

## Background on the Fix

The original implementation had several issues:

1. It was trying to use TensorFlow.js which wasn't properly loaded
2. It was making backend API calls to endpoints that didn't match the server
3. It had complex fallback logic that could get stuck in race conditions
4. Camera resources weren't properly released when switching modes

The new implementation simplifies the approach by using a proven pattern from another component in the same project that was working correctly.
