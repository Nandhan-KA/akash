# How to Fix Drowsiness Detection in the Driver Monitoring System

## The Problem

The drowsiness detection component in the browser is experiencing several issues:

1. **Camera Access Issues**: The camera frequently gets stuck or jammed when switching between detection modes
2. **TensorFlow.js Loading Failure**: Errors indicate TensorFlow.js isn't properly loaded
3. **CORS Errors**: Backend API calls are failing due to CORS issues
4. **Multiple Competing Systems**: The complex fallback logic between local and backend modes creates race conditions

These issues are causing the drowsiness detection to be unreliable compared to the emotion detection component which works flawlessly.

## The Solution

We've created a simplified drowsiness detection component based on the successful pattern used in the emotion-display component. The key improvements are:

1. **Simplified Code Flow**: Direct webcam access without complex fallbacks
2. **Face-API.js Only**: Removed dependency on TensorFlow.js which was causing issues
3. **Self-Contained Design**: Works standalone in the browser without requiring backend connection
4. **Proper Resource Management**: Properly releases camera resources when stopping detection

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Using the Batch Script (Recommended)

1. Run the provided batch script from your project root:
   ```
   swap_monitors.bat
   ```

2. Restart your Next.js application:
   ```
   cd new_project
   npm run dev
   ```

3. If you need to revert to the original implementation, follow the instructions shown by the batch script.

### Option 2: Manual Implementation

1. Backup your original file:
   ```
   copy new_project\components\drowsiness-monitor.tsx new_project\components\drowsiness-monitor.backup.tsx
   ```

2. Replace it with the simplified version:
   ```
   copy new_project\components\drowsiness-monitor-simple.tsx new_project\components\drowsiness-monitor.tsx
   ```

3. Restart your Next.js application

## Comparing the Two Approaches

### Original Approach
- Uses a complex controller to manage two detection modes (backend and local)
- Attempts to load both Face-API.js and TensorFlow.js
- Has multiple fallback mechanisms that can interfere with each other
- Makes API calls to the Python backend that may fail due to CORS issues

### New Approach
- Uses a single, streamlined detection mode based directly on Face-API.js
- Implemented using React hooks and refs for cleaner state management
- Follows the pattern used in the emotion detection component
- Properly handles camera resources and animation frames

## Technical Details

The new implementation calculates drowsiness using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method:

1. Detects facial landmarks using Face-API.js
2. Calculates the EAR value based on eye landmark positions
3. Detects prolonged eye closure (low EAR value) as a sign of drowsiness
4. Tracks blinks as a secondary indicator

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after applying the fix:

1. **Camera Access Issues**:
   - Ensure your browser has camera permissions
   - Check if any other applications are using the camera
   - Try a different browser to rule out browser-specific issues

2. **Model Loading Issues**:
   - Make sure the models are correctly placed in the `/public/models/face-api` directory
   - Check browser console for specific error messages

3. **If the Camera Appears Frozen**:
   - Click "Stop Monitoring" and then "Start Monitoring" again
   - Refresh the page if stopping doesn't release the camera
